    steps:
    # 1. Check out the code (CRITICAL: This was missing)
    - name: Checkout code
      uses: actions/checkout@v4

    # 2. Set up Java (Android builds usually require JDK 17 or 11)
    - name: Set up JDK 17
      uses: actions/setup-java@v4
      with:
        java-version: '17'
        distribution: 'temurin'
    
    # 3. Set up Gradle (Installs Gradle so we don't need the missing wrapper)
    - name: Setup Gradle
      uses: gradle/actions/setup-gradle@v3
      with:
        gradle-version: current

    # 4. Build the APK using the system 'gradle' command
    # (We removed './gradlew' to bypass the missing jar file error)
    - name: Build with Gradle
      run: gradle build

    # 5. (Optional) Upload the APK so you can download it from GitHub
